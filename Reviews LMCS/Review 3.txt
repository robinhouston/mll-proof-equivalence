Review for 
"Proof equivalence in MLL is PSPACE-complete"
Willem Heijltjes, Robin Houston


This is a well-written paper containing a non-trivial result. I
reviewed it already for CSL-LICS2014, and all my concerns back then
have been taken into account. Since my review from then is available
to the editor, there is not need for writing a detailed review now. 

There is only one concern: The content of the paper is essential
the same as the CSL-LICS2014 publication. Except for some better
explanations here and there, there is no added value in the current
paper. I don't know what the policy of LMCS is in this respect, so I
have to leave the decision to the editor.

Some technical comments (yes, I still found things to complain about)
-----------------------

- Section 6 is totally out of place. It should come right after all
 the proof-net stuff and not brutally separate sections 5 and 7 which
 should be immediately one after the other.

- check the capitalization in the bibliography.

- p.19, after def 16:  s(v) < s(v)  ????

- p.19, def 18: isn't the empire the largest subnet with ... ?

- p.21: the bijection associates f(1) to j and c(3) to f (or did I
 miss something?)

- p.24, def 33: The C is used in two different meanings here.

- p.26, lem 38: The sentence is grammatically ambiguous, and the wrong
 meaning comes in first. (just make it two sentences)
