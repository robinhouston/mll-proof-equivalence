\title{The proof equivalence problem for multiplicative linear logic is \textsc{pspace}-complete v0.3}


\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
MLL proof equivalence is the problem of deciding whether two proofs are related by a series of rule permutations.
%
Previous work has shown the problem to be equivalent to a rewiring problem on proof nets, which are not canonical for full MLL due to the presence of the two units.
%
Drawing from recent work on reconfiguration problems, in this paper it is shown that MLL proof equivalence is PSPACE-complete, using a reduction from Nondeterministic Constraint Logic.
