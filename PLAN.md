# Rough plan of attack

## Introduction

* Motivation
* Proof nets
* Reconfiguration problems
* There are no canonical proof nets
* Related work

## Background

* Define MLL
* Introduce proof nets and the rewiring operation
* Define star-autonomous categories
* Complexity of related problems: additives, intuitionistic MLL, MLL without units, lambda-calculus.
* NP-completeness of (unit-only) MLL provability.
%
* Explain we will work in the unit-only fragment
* Our notation
* Box-depth

## Level 0

* Introduce the situation
* Define parity, and prove that every rewiring step has even parity
* If there is more than one octopus that has more than one arm, every even permutation is realisable

## Level 1

* Introduce the situation
* Numerical notation for tensor-of-bottoms and par-of-1s
* Numerical matching behaviour; simple NP-completeness of provability
* The permutation gadget
* NP-hardness of proof equivalence
* (Relationship with / encodability of Demaine-Ito subset sum reconfiguration)
* Extend parity proof to par

## Level 2 informally

* Introduce NCL, and progressive configurations
* How to encode nodes and edges, using the numerical properties to restrict connectivity
* Rolling off and on one edge, using the permutation gadget to fix it up afterwards
* Other ways (bad ways) edges can connect to nodes, and why they can only do so to a limited extent

## Level 2 formally

* Precise definitions and proofs

## Conclusion

* Mention the open problem at level 1.
* Say something about the shortage of models?
